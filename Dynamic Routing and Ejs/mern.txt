setting up parser for form

setting up ejs for ejs pages
    install ejs from npm
//in ejs we can basically perform calculation or other things in html like jsx
    setup ejs as a view engine
    app.set('view engine' , 'ejs')
    
// then instead of res.send we use res.render('ejs file name that we created in viewss')

//so it will now go to views folder and look for index file name if it is found 
    then it will show us the pages

//to calculate something is ejs: <%= 2+2 %>



-----------
#dynamic route

/profile/ahanaf
/profile/hasim

here the name is dynamic. so we need to use : before that dynamic part
// : means it is dynamic. that is a variable now

/profile/:name 


now to get its value

we use req.params.name (here 'name' can be anything that we wrote after the : in the route)
